        Build multiple Blackjack hands to score as many points as possible.<br /><br />
        <i><b>THE DEAL</b></i><br />
        The table starts the game empty. The Stock flips over one card.<br /><br />
        <i><b>STOCK</b></i><br />
        The face up card near the Stock must be played to a place in the Blackjack hands or a Discard Pile.
        As each card is played, the Stock will automatically flip another card.<br />

        <i><b>SCORING</b></i><br />
        Scoring for the various Blackjack hands is based on how close the player comes to 21 in each hand. Face cards count as 10. Aces can count as either 1 or 11.<br /><br />
        Each of the nine hands are scored as follows:<br /><br />

        <i>10 Points:</i> Blackjack! A Blackjack is two cards that total 21. A King, Queen, Jack, or 10 combined with an Ace<br />
        <i>7 Points :</i> All cards in hand that total 21<br />
        <i>5 Points :</i> Total 20<br />
        <i>4 Points :</i> Total 19<br />
        <i>3 Points :</i> Total 18<br />
        <i>2 Points :</i> Total 17<br />
        <i>1 Point  :</i> Total 16 or less<br />
        <i>0 Point  :</i> Bust! Total 22 or more<br /><br />
        The scores from all nine hands are added together to arrive at the final score.<br />
